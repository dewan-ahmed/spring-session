broader community monitor the https://stackoverflow.com/tags/spring-session[`spring-session`]

== Create your branch from the oldest maintenance branch

Create your topic branch to be submitted as a pull request from the oldest impacted and supported maintenance branch.
You can find the supported versions by looking at the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-session/milestones[milestones page].
Switch to a branch named `<major>.<minor>.x` from the smallest milestone in the format of `<major>.<minor>.<patch>(-<prerelease>)`.
The spring team will ensure the code gets merged forward into additional branches.


== Add Signed-off-by Trailer
